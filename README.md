Python control of an electrothermal atomizer system - programming fragments and studies

These are fragments of programming toward the goal of managing a tungsten electrothermal atomizer from a single Python GUI.  Control of hardware and data processing with user interaction are all parts of the goal.  An eventual solution will include:  
  * Serial communication (bidirectional) for hardware control  
  * Spectrometer interaction via SeaBreeze  
  * GUI that shows experiment conditions  
  * Animated Matplotlib plot showing live spectrometer results  
  * Mouse pointer selection of data from Matplotlib figure
